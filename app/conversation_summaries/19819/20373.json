Each description provided a detailed visual layout description in Latin, reflecting architectural, clothing, ornamental, and furnishing styles. Queen Wyszeslawa, while acknowledging the Latin text, inserted a snippet of Latin text of her own, seemingly unrelated to the initial topic of conversation, but often used to indicate placeholder text in web design, ultimately derived from a Cicero work. Her addition consisted of a lengthy, classical rights and obligation discourse. No response from King Bolesław was explicitly stated, indicating the conversation was possibly a one-sided query or request for feedback on the design descriptions provided."
