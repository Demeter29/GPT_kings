The duchess raises an eyebrow and shows amusement upon being told of a test, to which the duke responds negatively. She then adopts a curious and slightly confused expression as she awaits further instructions from the duke, who simply replies with the word \"what.\" Świętosława, using non-verbal cues and body language, continues to challenge Vratislav to provide more context, but he only responds with a simple \"okay.\" She remains patient, committed to serving him, and awaits his next move. The conversation is filled with subtle hints and nuanced tones, highlighting the complex relationship between the two characters."
