After returning her attention to him, she reassured him that she saw herself as his partner in the kingdom. However, King Harald responded with actions that seemed out of character, such as slapping her and attempting to kill her, which the revised instructions suggest he did not do. Queen Yelizaveta responded with confusion, fear, and attempts to reason with him, before slipping away in the latter scenario."
