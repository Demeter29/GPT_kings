		"content": "\nKlára, a strong and independent woman, greets Duke Vratislav with respect but quickly becomes offended when he offers her gold for talking to him. She makes it clear that she is not property to be bought and becomes increasingly angry as the Duke continues to disrespect her. When the Duke touches her without consent, Klára defends herself by swinging her sword at him. After wounding him, she declares victory over the weak king who was defeated by a lowborn woman."
