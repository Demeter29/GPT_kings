When Count Mihály asks if she thinks he has cut his hair, she denies it but remains puzzled by his appearance. They agree to stroll through the gardens together and discuss their counties and a possible relationship between them. However, when Count Mihály suddenly forces a kiss upon her without warning, she is taken aback and pulls away, reminding him that they have only just met and should take things slowly. When Count Mihály insists that this is not their first kiss, a confused Countess Sugárka explains that she does not remember any such event."
