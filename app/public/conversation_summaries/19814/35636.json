		"content": "\nPiarres, the Court Musician and Acclaimed Knight of King Bolesław II 'the Bold' of Poland, greeted the king and offered his services. King Bolesław asked who Piarres was, to which Piarres gracefully introduced himself. King Bolesław then requested a song from Piarres in exchange for five gold pieces. Piarres eagerly agreed and asked the king what type of song he would prefer, offering him a choice between a ballad of love and loss, a victory anthem, or a lively tune. Piarres awaits the king's response, preparing himself to perform the chosen song and potentially gain the king's favor."
