Count Tatomir attributes his fervor to their last meeting, which the queen struggles to recall. She invites him to share any news or tales, expressing her curiosity about the realm's goings-on. The count, however, remains focused on their previous encounter and its pleasant nature, which the queen finally recalls. The conversation continues with the queen expressing her enjoyment of their discussions, while the count maintains his enthusiasm, albeit tempered by the queen's reminder of their public setting and the need for restraint."
