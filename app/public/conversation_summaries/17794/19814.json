		"content": " King Bolesław and Count Tatomir had a tense conversation in which the count declared his intention to seek independence from the king. King Bolesław, initially warm and welcoming, became visibly angry and expressed his disappointment that Tatomir had forgotten his oaths of loyalty. He reminded Tatomir of the protection and privileges he enjoyed under his rule and attempted to dissuade him from pursuing independence. However, Tatomir remained resolute, leading King Bolesław to declare him a rebel and order the seizure of his lands and assets. He warned that any who supported Tatomir would face the full wrath of the crown and expressed his disappointment that Tatomir had chosen this path. The conversation ended with King Bolesław expressing his hope that God would have mercy on Tatomir's soul."
