		"content": " In the conversation between Lambert, the trusted knight and Master of the Hunt, and Count Tatomir, his liege lord, Lambert informed the count of potential treachery from a rival, Jakub, who has been rallying support from local nobles and even posing a challenge to Count Tatomir's rule. Count Tatomir, in response, expressed his anger towards Jakub's behavior and gave Lambert the task to disrupt Jakub's plans and remind the nobles of their allegiance. The count also appointed Lambert as his envoy to meet with Baron Karol of Wizna to forge a new alliance, and to show the price of disloyalty. Count Tatomir then dismissed Lambert to carry out his orders. Lambert and Count Tatomir both agreed on the need to act swiftly and decisively for the sake of Sandomierz."
