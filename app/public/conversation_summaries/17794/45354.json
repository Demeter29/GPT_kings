		"content": " Countess Gertruda welcomes her husband, Count Tatomir, home from his hunt and inquires about his well-being, particularly concerning his old war injury. She expresses her concern with a hint of mockery, knowing his tendency to overexert himself. The Countess mentions that a feast is being prepared in his honor and encourages him to leave room for it, as the cooks have worked hard to prepare the meal. Throughout the conversation, their familiarity and long-standing marriage are evident in the Countess's teasing tone."
