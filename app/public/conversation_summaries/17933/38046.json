Petty Queen Muirgel, serving as the assistant, provided a detailed response outlining potential scenarios based on historical precedents and strategic considerations. She emphasized the importance of assessing the strength of his own kingdom's forces, understanding the geographical features of the target kingdom, and considering diplomatic options before resorting to military action. The queen also highlighted potential consequences such as loss of lives, economic strain, and potential retaliation from allied kingdoms.
