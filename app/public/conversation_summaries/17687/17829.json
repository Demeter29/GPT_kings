		"content": "In the conversation, King Iziaslav approaches Queen Gertruda and inquires about her wellbeing to which she responds positively. Curious about his sudden presence and question, she asks if anything is on his mind. When he expresses interest in knowing something new, Queen Gertruda hesitantly reveals that she has given birth to their daughter, Boleslava on January 10th, 1070. The revelation seems to make her somewhat anxious as she waits for King Iziaslav's reaction."
