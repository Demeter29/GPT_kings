The user requested a meeting time that accommodates the availability of his team members and the assistant. They initially discussed the possibility of scheduling the meeting on Thursday, but the assistant informed the user that she is unavailable on that day. The user then suggested Friday, to which the assistant responded positively. However, the assistant advised the user to confirm the availability of his team members before finalizing the time. The user agreed, and they decided to meet at 10:00 AM on Friday, pending team confirmation."
