		"content": " King László angrily questioned Count Sámuel about a lost battle, to which the Count calmly and respectfully responded that it was due to a combination of factors, including Count Elek's well-prepared forces and a better position, underestimation of the enemy's strength, and scouts' failure to accurately assess the situation. Count Sámuel took full responsibility for the defeat and promised to improve his strategies. In response to the King's anger, Count Sámuel showed surprise and pain but remained silent and loyal, even as the King pushed a dagger through his shoulder. Despite the physical and emotional pain, Count Sámuel maintained his composure and waited for the King's next words."
